RELEASE LOG FOR DNRGPS

3/5/2012 -- Verison 6.0.0.11 RELEASE
    ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY AND NOTES
	Added TIDENT field to Tracks.  I came to the realization that tracks in GPX files can 
		contain a name for a given track as well as a name for each point within that track.
		So now, the TIDENT field contains the name of the track.  The IDENT field in the track 
		table contains a unique ID for each track point.  It works similarly to the RIDENT field 
		for routes.
